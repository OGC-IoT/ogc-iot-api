# OGC SensorThings API

This is the home of the SensorThings API, a [Draft Standard](http://ogc-iot.github.io/ogc-iot-api/) of the [Open Geospatial Consortium](www.opengeospatial.org/) SensorThings API. The OGC SensorThings API is a work from the OGC [Sensor Web Interface for Internet of Things Standards Woring Group (SW-IoT SWG)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/sweiotswg).
 
The OGC SensorThings API is an OGC candidate standard for providing an open and unified way to interconnect IoT devices, data, and applications over the Web. The SensorThings API is an open standard, builds on Web protocols and applies an easy-to-use RESTful style. The result is to provide a uniform way to expose the full potential of the Internet of Things.

#About
This GitHub repository is the latest version of the OGC SensorThings API draft. With this repository the OGC invites collaboration and comments directed at the development and enhancement of this candidate standard.

Based on feedback the final 1.0 specification will likely change, so consider this a work in progress, that you are encouraged to help shape. The OGC SW-IoT working group is particularly interested in making the specification easy to implement, so changes driven by attempted implementations will be given high priority.

#Reading the specification
You can [read the html version of the specification here](http://ogc-iot.github.io/ogc-iot-api/index.html).

#Try out the SensorThings API
You can even try out an example implementation of the SensorThings API. [The Ecosystem page](http://ogc-iot.github.io/ogc-iot-api/ecosystem.html) lists the existing implementations of the SensorThings API. For example, you can [try an example SensorThings server here](http://demo.student.geocens.ca:8080/SensorThings_V1.0/).

#How to give feedback?
